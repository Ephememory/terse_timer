# terse_timer

A cmdline/terminal quick-start timer for when I want a timer and want it now. 
Sometimes browser timers just don't ring for some reason or may not even appear in a search result, so I just made a little timer.

```
// Tea timer
$ tt 4m
$ Setting timer: 0h, 4m, 0s
$ Timer starting @ current time: 2023-03-30 23:35:09.536359800 +0000 UTC
$ 0h 3m 54s left

// Free pizza
$ tt 31m

// Random timers
$ tt 10s
$ tt 3.5h
$ tt 0.5m

// Defaults to minutes
$ tt 10 
(10 minutes)
```
